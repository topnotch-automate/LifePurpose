Every sincere spiritual quest eventually arrives at one unavoidable question:

**Who am I?**

Not what you do.
Not what you believe.
Not what you have been taught to call yourself.

But what you are, before all labels, roles, and histories.
Until this question is answered clearly, all practice remains unstable.

## Man and the Breath of Life

Scripture tells us that man was formed from the dust of the ground, but he did not become a living being until the breath of God entered him.

This is not a biological account.
It is a spiritual principle.

The body, by itself, is form.
Life enters when Spirit animates it.

Man, therefore, is not merely a body that possesses life.
**Man is Life expressing itself through form.**

## Identity Is Not Earned

One of the greatest confusions in spiritual pursuit is the idea that identity must be achieved.

But identity precedes effort.

You do not practice to become spiritual.
You practice because you already are.

The error is not a lack of effort; it is **misidentification.**

When a man believes himself separate from Life, he strives anxiously. 
When he knows himself as Life, practice becomes alignment, not struggle.

## The Inner Meaning of “I AM”

Throughout scripture, the name of God is revealed as I AM.

This is not a title.
It is a state of being.

Whenever you say “I am,” you are invoking identity. 
The question is not whether you are creating, but **what you are agreeing with** when you speak.

Identity governs perception.
Perception governs experience.

To misunderstand identity is to misinterpret life.

## A Necessary Reorientation

This teaching does not ask you to deny your humanity.
It asks you to understand it correctly.

You are not a body trying to reach Spirit.
You are Spirit learning to express consciously through a body.

This single correction changes everything:
+ how you pray
+ how you discipline yourself
+ how you relate to circumstances
+ how you understand success and failure

Without this foundation, spiritual effort becomes exhaustion.

## A Quite Instruction

Do not rush to apply this intellectually.

Instead, sit with one simple recognition:
* Life is not something I seek.
* Life is what I am learning to live consciously.

Let this understanding settle before moving forward.

This is a series on identity. Patiently await the following series for clarity.
Thank you for choosing this. 

Do you think confusion of your identity can result into confusion in every area of your life?
