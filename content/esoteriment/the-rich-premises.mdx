They are lenses.

If you wish to see what I am pointing to, I must first offer you the same lenses through which I see.

## The First Premise — The Revelation of the Life Principle

Imagine a world in which humanity lived without conscious understanding of life, identity, or purpose.

According to sacred tradition, this ignorance did not persist indefinitely.
The **Life Principle**—the nature of God, the nature of man, and the purpose of existence—was revealed to the earliest human consciousness.

This revelation was preserved, not merely as history, but as instruction.

The Bible, and other spiritual texts stands as a record of this revelation:
a collection of teachings intended for learning, correction, and awakening—not blind belief.

It is not a book about ancient people alone, but about **perennial truths**.

## The Second Premise — The Law of the Mind

Dr. Joseph Murphy articulated what many overlook:

The Bible is a **spiritual and psychological book**.

Its primary concern is not external ritual, but the **law governing the human mind**—how thought, belief, and feeling shape experience, and how God works through consciousness.

When approached in this way, scripture shifts from doctrine to instruction.
It becomes a manual for understanding cause and effect at the level of consciousness.

## The Third Premise — Scripture as Inner Drama

Neville Goddard carried this understanding further.

He taught that the stories, characters, and events recorded in the Bible are not merely historical accounts, but **symbolic dramas** unfolding within the consciousness of man.

Kings, prophets, wars, journeys, exile, and redemption represent inner movements of awareness, identity, and realization.

Scripture, then, is not primarily about what happened *then*, but about what is happening *now*—within the individual.

## How These Premises Shape This Work

Everything you encounter here—whether article, teaching, or reflection—is shaped by these three premises:

1. That truth is revealed through consciousness
2. That the mind is the creative instrument
3. That scripture speaks inwardly before it speaks outwardly

This is why the language may feel symbolic rather than literal.
This is why emphasis is placed on identity rather than behavior.
This is why application follows understanding.

## An Invitation, Not a Demand

These premises are not imposed.
They are offered.

If you adopt them, even temporarily, the teachings will reveal their coherence.
If you resist them, much of what follows will appear obscured or contradictory.

Understanding requires a shared point of view.

> **If I want you to see what I am seeing,
> I must first lend you these lenses.**

Read slowly.
Reflect honestly.
Test inwardly.

That is how this work is meant to be approached.

Thank you, for choosing this.
