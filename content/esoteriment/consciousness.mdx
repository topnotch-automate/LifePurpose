Consciousness is not something you possess.  
It is what you **are**.

> That which observes cannot itself be observed.

This single realisation dissolves confusion. Most people speak of consciousness as if it were a quality of the brain, an emergent property, or something that can be measured. But consciousness precedes measurement. It is the prerequisite for any observation.

## The Observer Problem

When you attempt to observe consciousness, what are you using? Consciousness itself. This creates an infinite recursion that materialist science cannot resolve. You cannot observe the observer without becoming the observed.

## Beyond the Brain

The brain processes information. It filters, organizes, and interprets. But the *awareness* that knows these processes—that is something else entirely. The brain is an instrument. Consciousness is the musician.

## Practical Implications

When you recognize consciousness as your fundamental nature:

- **Identity shifts**: You stop identifying with thoughts, emotions, or even the body
- **Freedom emerges**: What seemed fixed becomes fluid
- **Clarity deepens**: The noise of personality gives way to silent presence

This understanding doesn't require belief. It requires direct recognition. Look now. What is it that knows these words? That is consciousness.
