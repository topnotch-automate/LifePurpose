> As above, so below. As below, so above.

The Law of Correspondence is one of the seven Hermetic principles, and perhaps the most immediately practical. It states that there is a relationship, correspondence, and harmony between different planes of existence.

## The Three Planes

1. **Physical** - The material world we perceive with our senses
2. **Mental** - The realm of thoughts, beliefs, and mental patterns
3. **Spiritual** - The realm of essence, truth, and ultimate reality

What appears on one plane reflects on the others. The outer world mirrors the inner world. Your external circumstances correspond to your internal state.

## Practical Application

Notice patterns. If chaos appears in your external life, look within. What mental patterns are creating this? If you want to change your circumstances, change your thoughts first. The outer will follow.

## The Microcosm and Macrocosm

You are a microcosm of the universe. The same laws that govern the cosmos govern you. This is not metaphor—it is correspondence. Study yourself to understand the universe. Study the universe to understand yourself.

## Meditation

Contemplate: What in your life reflects your inner state? What patterns appear across different areas—relationships, work, health? Where is the correspondence?
