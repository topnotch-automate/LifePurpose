**End of The Identity Series**

> Before anything else, a simple truth must be acknowledged:

> You were born with amnesia.

This forgetting is not a mistake, nor a punishment.
It is part of the divine order through which growth becomes possible.
You begin life identified with form, time, and separation, long before you awaken to the deeper reality of your being.

For a season, you live as though you are merely a separate individual in a vast world—defined by body, history, achievement, and limitation.
From this level of awareness, you reason, choose, and act.

Yet this is not the truth of what you are.

## Your True Nature and the Natural State

At the core of your being, you are Spirit.

Spirit is not something you possess; it is what you are. It is the essence of God’s creation and the animating Life behind all form. However, before this is consciously realised, you live primarily as a natural being—identified with the body and the world of appearances.

Scripture names this mode of awareness **the flesh**.

The flesh is not the body itself, nor is it evil. It is a _thought system_—a way of perceiving life that arises from ignorance of one’s true nature. It is the mindset of separation: from God, from Life, and even from oneself.

A person may believe in God and still live from the flesh if God is perceived as distant, external, or separate.

## What It Means to Be “In Christ”

To be _in Christ_ is not to adopt a religious identity.
It is to awaken to a spiritual reality—your true identity.

Christ is the living principle of divine awareness within you—the truth of what you are beyond the fleshly sense of self. To be in Christ is to become **consciously aligned with this inner truth** and to allow it to govern your daily living.

This is why scripture speaks of being “in Christ” rather than merely following Christ.

Christ is not outside you, waiting to be reached.
Christ is the inner Life awakening to itself.

## One with God, Not Separate

Awakening to your spiritual estate reveals a quiet but profound realisation:
You are one with God.

This does not erase individuality. You remain unique, expressive, and distinct. But you are no longer separate. You are an integral expression of the One Life, participating consciously in its unfolding.

The name Jesus symbolises this realised consciousness. In the New Testament, Jesus expresses the same eternal truth revealed as I AM in the Old Testament—pointing not to a personality alone, but to **pure being**, timeless awareness, and divine identity.

## Death to the Old Awareness

Though you are Spirit, much of your life may still be lived as though you are only a body.

Achievements, intellect, possessions, and status can quietly become substitutes for your true identity. When spiritual awareness dawns, this former mode of living must give way.

Scripture calls this death, not of the body, but of the old awareness.

To “crucify the flesh” is to release the belief systems, values, and methods that arise from separation and fear. It is not self-denial for its own sake, but a conscious **parting from what no longer reflects truth**.

This is what it means to offer oneself “as a living sacrifice.”

## Sacrifice Reconsidered

To sacrifice is to release something that once felt essential.

The passions and desires of the flesh represent the wisdom of a world that seeks fulfilment from the outside in—through force, manipulation, competition, and control. These methods promise gain but ultimately diminish life. They are not **lifeward**.

When this way of living is surrendered, another principle becomes active: creation from the inside out.

Here, desire is not forced into form. It is entrusted to God and expressed through patience, responsibility, and love.

## Faith Expressing Itself Through Love

True faith is not belief alone.
It is an **inner agreement expressed through life**.

To live in Christ is to embody this agreement daily—to think, act, and choose from alignment rather than fear. You no longer attempt to bend life to your will. You work with God, allowing Life to unfold through clarity and faithfulness.
This is freedom in Christ.

Not freedom from responsibility, but freedom from false identity.
Not escape from life, but participation in it consciously.
