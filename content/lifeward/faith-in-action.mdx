Faith is not belief without evidence.  
It is alignment with truth before evidence.

Most people misunderstand faith. They think it means ignoring reality or hoping for the impossible. But true faith is the most practical force in existence.

## What Faith Really Is

Faith is acting as if what you desire is already true. It's not wishful thinking—it's the recognition that the invisible precedes the visible. You don't wait for evidence. You create it through your actions.

## The Cycle of Faith

1. **Recognition**: You see the truth that exists beyond current circumstances
2. **Alignment**: You align your thoughts, words, and actions with that truth
3. **Manifestation**: The outer world reflects the inner reality

## Daily Practice

Each morning, ask yourself: "If what I desire were already true, how would I act today?" Then act that way. Not as performance, but as recognition of what is.

Faith moves mountains because faith doesn't wait for mountains to move. It begins moving them by moving yourself.

## The Principle

> "Faith without works is dead."

Faith is not passive. It's active. It's the bridge between the invisible and visible. Step onto it, and walk forward.
