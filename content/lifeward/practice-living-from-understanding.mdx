## Practice Begins With attention

Spiritual practice begins with attention, not effort.

Where attention goes, life organises itself.

This includes:
* What you dwell on
* What you resist
* What you rehearse inwardly
* What you quietly expect

Attention is prayer in its most honest form.

## Discipline Without Harshness

True discipline is not force.
It is consistency born of clarity.

When identity is understood, discipline feels natural. 
You are no longer correcting a flawed self, but **expressing a true one**.

Gentle consistency reshapes life more effectively than intense bursts of effort.

---

## Faith As Inner agreement

Faith is not pretending something is true.

It is settling into agreement with what is.

When thought, feeling, and expectation align, action follows naturally. 
This is why struggle decreases as clarity increases.

You do not force life to cooperate.
You cooperate with the law.

## Living Lifeward

To live Lifeward is to:

+ return to clarity when confused

+ return to the principle when distracted

+ return to stillness when reactive

+ return to practice when inspired

This is not perfection.
It is faithfulness.

## A WORD BEFORE YOU CONTINUE

This work does not end here.

It begins.

You have not been given techniques to master, but principles to live with. Life itself will now become your teacher, faithfully reflecting understanding back to you.
Return to these series as needed.

Read slowly.
Practice gently.
Clarity matures with patience.
