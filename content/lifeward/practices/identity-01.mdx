## Orientation

Identity is the cause; effort is the expression.

## Practice

Before beginning any task today, pause briefly and ask:  
*"From who I believe I am, am I acting right now?"*

## LivingIntegration

Notice moments of strain. Strain often signals misidentification.

## QuietReminder

*I act from being, not toward it.*
