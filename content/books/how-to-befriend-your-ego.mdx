  ## Introduction

  The ego has been misunderstood.

  It is not the enemy of spiritual growth.
  It is the structure through which identity expresses.

  Conflict begins when the ego forgets its source.
  Harmony returns when identity aligns with truth.

  This book restores clarity to the conversation.
