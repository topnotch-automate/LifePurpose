  ## Chapter 1: The Foundation
  
  Manifestation is not about wishing. It's about **becoming**.
  
  When you assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled, you align your consciousness with the reality you desire. This is not magic—it's the natural law of consciousness operating through you.
  
  > "Assume the feeling of your wish fulfilled and observe the route that your attention follows." - Neville Goddard
  
  The key is to feel it real. Not as something you want, but as something you already have. This shift in consciousness is what quickens manifestation.
  
  ### The Three Pillars
  
  1. **Assumption** - Assume the state of having what you desire
  2. **Feeling** - Feel the reality of it now
  3. **Persistence** - Maintain the assumption until it manifests
  
  When these three align, manifestation accelerates.
