  ## Introduction

  "Remain faithful unto death" is not a call to physical death.

  It is a call to the death of the identity that resists your becoming.

  Manifestation is not accelerated by force. It unfolds through alignment.
  What delays outcomes is not lack of desire, but divided consciousness.

  This work is not about techniques.
  It is about structural transformation.

  ## Section I: The Law of Becoming

  ### Death as Structural Release

  Psychological death is the withdrawal of loyalty from an old identity.

  The former self—shaped by fear, limitation, and misalignment—must lose authority.
  Not through struggle.
  Through conscious replacement.

  Transformation is not emotional.
  It is structural.

  ### Double-Mindedness and Division

  A divided mind cannot embody a new identity.

  The double-minded person:

  - Desires growth but protects the old self
  - Speaks faith but lives from fear
  - Accepts the law intellectually but resists embodiment

  Division delays becoming.

  ### Faith as Conscious Alignment

  Faith is not hope.
  Faith is conscious agreement with law.

  When identity aligns with law, outcomes adjust accordingly.
  This is not mysticism.
  It is structure.

  You do not force manifestation.
  You become aligned—and life reflects that alignment.

  > “I die daily.”

  Becoming is not a moment.
  It is a practice.
