  ## Introduction

  Prayer is one of the most misunderstood acts in human life.

  It has been reduced to persuasion — an attempt to convince God to act.
  Yet prayer was never meant to change God.

  Prayer changes orientation.

  Life responds not to pleading, but to agreement.

  ## Section I: Seed and Soil

  ### Prayer Is Not Persuasion

  God is not moved by repetition.
  He is Principle — consistent, lawful, responsive.

  Prayer becomes effective when consciousness aligns with how life already works.

  ### The Farmer Principle

  A farmer does not beg the soil.
  He understands it.

  He prepares.
  He plants.
  He tends.
  He waits.

  When harvest comes, it is not a miracle.
  It is law.

  Prayer works the same way.

  Understanding precedes manifestation.

  ### Faith as Inner Agreement

  Faith is not force.
  It is agreement with what is true.

  When inner agreement is established,
  life responds naturally.

  The prayerful farmer does not plead.
  He cooperates.
