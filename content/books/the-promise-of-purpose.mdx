  ## Introduction

  Purpose is not discovered.
  It is revealed through alignment.

  Fate feels random when law is misunderstood.
  Destiny becomes clear when identity aligns with principle.

  This book explores the structural relationship between:
  - Identity
  - Faith
  - Divine Law
  - Lived Experience

  Purpose is not emotional inspiration.
  It is lawful becoming.
